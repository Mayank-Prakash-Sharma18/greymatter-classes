Latitude & Longitude - Imaginary lines drawn on the globe.

<img src="../../../media/earth/latitudes-and-longitudes.png" alt="latitudes and longitudes" style="width:63%;height:63%;">

Lines running east and west, parallel to the equator - Lines/Parallels of latitude. 

Lines running north and south passing through the poles - Lines/Meridians of longitude 

The  intersection of latitude and longitude pin-points any place on the earth’s surface.

## Latitude

Latitude - angular distance (in degrees) of a point on the earth's surface from the centre of the earth. 

<img src="../../../media/earth/latitude-angular-distance.png" alt="latitude angular distance" style="width:81%;height:81%;">

* Latitude lines/Parallels are parallel to the equator. 
* They are circles which get smaller polewards. 
* The equator represents 0° and the North and South Poles are 90°N and 90°S.
* Average linear distance of a degree of latitude = 69 miles (111 km)
* As the earth is slightly flattened at the poles, the linear distance of a degree of latitude at the pole is a little longer than that at the equator. 
* Each degree is sub-divided into 60 minutes and each minute into 60 seconds. 

### The most important lines of latitude:

## Longitude

Longitude - angular distance (in degrees) of a place east or west of the Prime Meridian.

{{% alert note %}}
Prime Meridian/Greenwich Meridian - Zero meridian (00) passes through the Royal Astronomical Observatory at Greenwich, near London.

All other meridians radiate eastward and westwards up to 180° from Prime Meridian.

* Lines of longitude/Meridians are a series of semi-circles that run from pole to pole (in a north-south direction) passing through the equator at right angles.
* Unlike latitudes, they are all equal in length. 
* 1° of longitude = 69.1 miles at the equator and 1° of longitude = 0 miles at the poles. 
* They determine local time in relation to Greenwich Mean Time (G.M.T.)/World Time.

## Coordinates

The combination of meridians of longitude and parallels of latitude establishes a <strong>framework or grid</strong>. 

Using this grid we can determine exact positions of any place <strong>in reference to the Prime meridian and the Equator</strong>. 

To provide a geographic location of a place using latitude and longitude - <strong>Coordinates</strong> are used.   

* The latitude has the symbol of phi & the longitude has the symbol of lambda.

* Latitude is always written first.

For example:<br>
A point - 40° N, 30° E <br>
It will be located 40° north of the Equator and 30° east of the Prime meridian.

To be even more precise - we should use minutes, and seconds along with degrees. <br> 
A point - 40° 35′ 26′′ N,  30° 12′ 38′′ E
