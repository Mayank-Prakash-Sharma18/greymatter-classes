Atmosphere consists of different layers. The density and temperature of these layers differ a lot.

* Density - It's highest near the surface of the earth. It decreases with increasing altitude. 

* Temperature - We divide the column of atmosphere into five different layers depending majorly upon the temperature conditions: <br><br>
These layers are:
* troposphere
* stratosphere
* mesosphere
* thermosphere and 
* exosphere

Let us study these layers one by one:

## Troposphere

#### Features of Troposphere

* Position - lowermost layer of the atmosphere. <br><br>
So, it can be considered the most important layer, as far as biological activity is concerned.

* Thickness - Its average height is 13 km. <br><br>
Thickness is greatest at the equator. (8 km near the poles and about 18 km at the equator)

* Weather & Climate - This layer contains dust particles and water vapour. Most of the climatic and weather related activities are confined to this layer. So, in Climatology we mostly confine ourselves to Troposphere (and to some extent Stratosphere).

#### Environmental Lapse Rate 
Actual rate of decline of temperature with increase in height of atmosphere at a particular place and a particular point of time.

#### Normal Lapse Rate (NLR) 
Average of ELR (a decline of about 6.4°C per km rise in the atmosphere OR a decline of 1°C for every 165 m of height).

### Tropopause

The zone separating the troposphere from stratosphere.

The temperature here is nearly constant (so called the tropopause). It is about - 80°C over the equator and about - 45°C over the poles.

{{% alert note %}}
Why lower temperature over the equator than the poles?

Troposphere has greater height over the equator than the poles. Higher the height lower will be the temperature.

## Stratosphere

#### Features of Troposphere

* Position - It is above the tropopause and extends up to a height of 50 km. <br><br>
It contains the ozone layer.

* Temperature – This layer is very cold. The temperature increases with height or remains constant (two contradicting theories).

* Here the air is extremely thin, without dust, smoke or water vapour. This layer is also cloudless. 

## Mesosphere

#### Features of Mesosphere

* Position - It lies above the stratosphere and extends up to a height of 80 km. 

* Temperature – decreases with height (reaches up to - 100°C at the height of 80 km).

Mesopause - The upper limit of mesosphere. 

## Thermosphere

#### Features of Thermosphere

* Position - located between 80 and 400 km above the mesopause. 

* Temperature – increases with height (reaches up to 1700°C).

## Exosphere

#### Features of Thermosphere

* Position - uppermost layer of the atmosphere above the thermosphere. It gradually merges with the outer space.  

## Ionosphere

Ionosphere is a special layer that overlaps the mesosphere, thermosphere, and exosphere. 

It’s very active part of the atmosphere, and grows and shrinks as it absorbs energy from the sun. Gases in these layers are excited by solar radiation to form electrically charged particles known as ions. Hence, this is called ionosphere. 

#### Features of Ionosphere

* Auroras - In ionosphere, ions are affected by the magnetic fields of both Earth and the sun. This is where auroras (bright, beautiful bands of light) happen. They are caused by high-energy particles from the sun interacting with the atoms in ionosphere.

* Radio transmission - Radio waves that are transmitted from the earth are reflected back to the earth by this layer. So, this layer makes short-wave radio transmission possible over long distances.
