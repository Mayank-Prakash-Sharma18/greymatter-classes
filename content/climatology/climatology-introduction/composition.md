## Atmosphere

Atmosphere is all around us. It can be traced upto a height of 10,000 km, but 90% of its mass is confined within 30 km from earth's surface.

#### But what exactly is Atmosphere?

It is a mixture of different gases around the earth, held to the earth by the force of gravity.

This mixture is called air. It is colourless and odourles.


## Composition of Atmosphere

The atmosphere is composed of: 

* Gases
* Water vapour
* Dust particles

## Gases

### Nitrogen ($N_2$) 

It is the most abundant gas in Earth’s atmosphere (around 78%).

### Oxygen ($O_2$) 

It's around 21% of all the gases in the atmosphere. It's almost in negligible quantity after the height of 120 km. Humans and animals need $O_2$. 

### Carbon di-oxide ($CO_2$)

Carbon di-oxide ($CO_2$) is found  only up to 90 km from the surface of the earth. Plants need $CO_2$. 

Green house effect – $CO_2$ is transparent to the incoming solar radiation but opaque to the outgoing terrestrial radiation.

It is rising in volume - Mainly because of the burning of fossil fuels. 

So, we are witnessing enhanced green house effect and rising global temperature.

Question: Which is the hottest planet in our solar system?

Answer: 
It's Venus, and not Mercury (even though Mercury is closer to the Sun than Venus). 

Do you know the reason? 
It's because of excessive levels of $CO_2$ in its atmosphere. 

Scientists think that at one point of time, Venus used to be just like Earth. It had atmosphere and oceans. But then the temperature rose and oceans vaporised. Due to excessive levels of water vapour and $CO_2$ in its atmosphere, greenhouse effect further raised the temperature levels and Venus fell into this vicious trap of ever-increasing temperatures. So much so that, scientists believe that there is rain of liquid metals on Venus.

### Ozone ($O_3$)

Found between 10 - 50 km above the earth’s surface.

UV filter - absorbs the ultra-violet rays coming from the sun, preventing them from reaching the surface of the earth.

## Water Vapour ($H_2O$ in gaseous state)

Amount of water vapour decreases with altitude - Found  only up to 90 km from the surface of the earth. (just like $CO_2$) 

Amount decreases from the equator towards the poles – Upto 4% of the air by volume in the warm and wet tropics, to less than 1% in the dry and cold areas of desert and polar regions.

Green house effect – It absorbs parts of the insolation from the sun and preserves the earth’s radiated heat.

Causes great contrasts in weather and climate over different parts of the world.

## Dust Particles

Origin of Dust Particles - Dust Particles come from various sources, such as sea salts, fine soil, smoke-soot, ash, pollen, meteors etc.

Amount decreases with altitude - Generally concentrated in the lower layers of the atmosphere.

Higher concentration in subtropical and temperate regions (in comparison to equatorial and polar regions) - due to dry winds. 

Cloud Formation - act as hygroscopic nuclei around which water vapour condenses.
